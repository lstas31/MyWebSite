More about me!


My name is Lorene and I am a senior pursuing a dual degree in Chemistry and Math at UMass! I am currently working in Min Chen's research group in the Chemistry and BMB Department. I am also working in the Jeff Blanchard's research group in the Biology Department. I am really interested in the mathematical side of the life sciences and super excited to graduate in the spring!
